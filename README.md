# Expanded-Fusion
Minecraft mod adding fusion reactors of varying kinds and tiers

## Note/Disclaimer

This mod currently uses a bunch of code from SilentChaos512 as template stuff until I finish the base libs/core elements seperately.
The main reason for using his code is that it is close to what I intend to do anyway so the refactor will be minimal.

You can view the WIP `README.md` for the dynamic forge registration code under [com.engineersbox.expandedfusion.core](https://github.com/EngineersBox/Expanded-Fusion/tree/main/src/main/java/com/engineersbox/expandedfusion/core)

## Overview

Fusion reactors of varying types and designs.
Reactors are centered around magnetic confinement designs.

Some of the reactors include:
* Tokamak
* Stellarator (Torsatron, Heliotron, Heliac or Helias)
* Bumpy Torus
